# stats-exam-questions

These are statistics exam questions created with the *exams* package in *R*. A couple of the questions have a focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion. Those with and without foci on EDI are in separate folders.

Note that these are just the Rmarkdown files for the *exams* package. I have not included the *R* scripts to convert these to the `.zip` files that get uploaded to various LMSs/VLEs (e.g., `exams::exams2moodle()`, `exams::exams2blackboard()`). This is because each LMS/VLE has different requirements, and I am not currently working in any of them, so I couldn't test any scripts that I wrote anyway.

Also, do not try to knit to pdf or MSWord format with the files formatted as they currently are. It won't work since the tables are set up for html only. Feel free to change that in your own fork, however.

But see the main [website for the exams package](https://www.r-exams.org/) for help, or the [site on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exams/index.html).
