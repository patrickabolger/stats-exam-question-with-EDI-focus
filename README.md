# stats-exam-questions-with-EDI-focus

These are statistics exam questions created with the *exams* package in *R*. A couple of the questions have a focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion. Those with and without foci on EDI are in separate folders.

Note that these are just the Rmarkdown files for the *exams* package. I have not included the *R* scripts to convert these to the `.zip` files that get uploaded to various LMSs/VLEs (e.g., `exams::exams2moodle()`, `exams::exams2blackboard()`). This is because each LMS/VLE has different requirements, and I am not currently working in any of them, so I couldn't test any scripts that I wrote anyway.

But see the main [website for the exams package](https://www.r-exams.org/) for help, or the [site on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exams/index.html).
